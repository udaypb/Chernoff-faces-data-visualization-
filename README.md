## Chernoff Faces Variation 

This is a data visualization experiment with chernoff faces as the main theme. 
Wine datasets are difficult to analyze visually and hence chernoff faces would be a good method to visualize more than one attribute for each of the different types of wines available in the wine dataset. 

Here a simple wine bottle design is being used as a chernoff variant. 

## The dataset
The wine dataset contains thousands of rows where each row represents a particular wine type. Each wine has more than 11 attributes and they can be visualized using the following features of the bottle:

- Feature 1 : Bolt Size
- Feature 2 : Cap Size
- Feature 3 : Bottle Height
- Feature 4 : Liquid Amount
- Feature 5 : Bottle opacity

The following are the attributes for each wine type:
"alcohol","malic acid","ash","alcalinity of ash","magnesium","total phenols","flavanoids","nonflavanoid phenols","proanthocyanins","color intensity","hue","OD280/OD315","proline"
